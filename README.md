# Train-Test-split
This function will separate images in Training, Validation and Testing folder in 80-20 ratio. We split the testing data into 2 folders, training and validation. Trainging images contains 90% of the train data and Validation images contains 10% of the data.

This will take the input folder directory path in DATA_DIR. It will create test and train folder inside the folder and split data in 80-20 for all the folders.
